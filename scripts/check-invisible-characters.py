# Fails on literal invisible, bidirectional control and separator characters
# in tracked text files. Literal bidirectional controls can make text read
# differently from what it is, and none of these characters show in review.
# Content that needs one must write it as an escape or an HTML entity.
#
# Rejected in every file: every character in the Unicode categories Cf
# (format, including U+FEFF, U+200B to U+200F, U+202A to U+202E and U+2066 to
# U+2069), Zl (U+2028) and Zp (U+2029). Categories come from Python's
# unicodedata tables, not a hand written list.
#
# Rejected unless the file is listed in scripts/invisible-characters-allowlist.txt:
# the lookalike no break space (U+00A0), narrow no break space (U+202F) and
# minus sign (U+2212).
#
# Files are read as bytes from the working tree. Only files whose extension is
# in BINARY_SIGNATURES are skipped as binary, and only when their content
# starts with that format's signature; a listed name with other content fails.
# Every other file must be valid UTF-8 and is checked in full, and a NUL byte
# is reported as U+0000, so a NUL cannot make a source file skip the check.
# Symlinks and submodules are skipped. A tracked file missing from the working
# tree fails.
#
# Standard library only, no dependencies.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-invisible-characters.py [path inside the repo]
# Exit codes: 0 clean, 1 findings named on stderr, 2 the tree could not be
# listed.
